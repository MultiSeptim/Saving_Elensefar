# Saving Elensefar

> "Meneldur, elvish mariner of Elensefar, is driven to sea by the same orcs who attacked the city. He must gather an army willing to fight for him to regain Elensefar, his adopted homeland."

This version of **Saving Elensefar** is forked directly from turin's original on the Wesnoth 1.2 [add-ons server](https://add-ons.wesnoth.org/1.2/). It was created as a minimalist alternative to [trewe's version](https://github.com/trewe/Saving_Elensefar) and aims to emphasize traditional gameplay and mainline graphics.
