Saving Elensefar
================

Saving Elensefar is a campaign for the turn-based strategy game [The Battle for Wesnoth]. The original author of this campaign was Turin, who released it in 2004 on the [wesnoth forums] and later on the 1.2 [add-ons server]. He abandoned the campaign in 2008 and it was forked by different maintainers ever since.

This particular fork is [MoonyDragon's version], which was created as a minimalist alternative to [Trewe's version]. It focuses on (1) traditional gameplay, (2) mainline graphics, and (3) translation support.
